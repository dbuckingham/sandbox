Script for Learning Git
=======================
- Create GitHub repository.
- Clone GitHub repository to local.
- Due to my OCD, rename remote from origin to github.

	$ git remote rename origin github

- SourceTree should automatically pickup the newly renamed github remote.
- Create a branch called 'development'.  This will create a local branch, not a remote branch in the central repo (github).
- Make some commits. 
- Make some more commits.
